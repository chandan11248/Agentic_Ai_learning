    "## Section 1: Synchronous LangGraph with Custom Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's Demonstrated\n",
    "This section shows how to build a basic LangGraph agent with a custom calculator tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Tool Definition\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@tool\n",
    "def calculator(first_num: float, second_num: float, operation: str) -> dict:\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    Perform a basic arithmetic operation on two numbers.\n",
    "    Supported operations: add, sub, mul, div\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    # Implementation handles add, sub, mul, div operations\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Point**: Tools must have clear docstrings - the LLM uses these to decide when to call the tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. LLM Configuration\n",
    "```python\n",
    "llm = ChatGroq(model='openai/gpt-oss-20b')\n",
    "llm_with_tools = llm.bind_tools(tools)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Point**: `bind_tools()` gives the LLM awareness of available tools without requiring manual prompting.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. State Definition\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class ChatState(TypedDict):\n",
    "    messages: Annotated[list[BaseMessage], add_messages]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Point**: `add_messages` is a reducer function that automatically handles message accumulation, preventing duplicates and maintaining conversation history.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Graph Construction\n",
    "```python\n",
    "graph = StateGraph(ChatState)\n",
    "graph.add_node(\"chat_node\", chat_node)\n",
    "graph.add_node(\"tools\", tool_node)\n",
    "\n",
    "graph.add_edge(START, \"chat_node\")\n",
    "graph.add_conditional_edges(\"chat_node\", tools_condition)\n",
    "graph.add_edge(\"tools\", \"chat_node\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Point**: \n",
    "- `tools_condition` automatically determines if the LLM wants to call a tool\n",
    "- The graph creates a loop: chat → tools → chat, allowing multiple tool calls\n",
    "- This enables the agent to use tools iteratively to solve complex problems\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Execution\n",
    "```python\n",
    "chatbot = graph.compile()\n",
    "result = chatbot.invoke({\"messages\": [HumanMessage(content=\"...\")]})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "- ✅ How to create custom LangChain tools\n",
    "- ✅ Building a stateful conversation graph\n",
    "- ✅ Synchronous tool calling with automatic routing\n",
    "- ✅ Message state management\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Section 2: Asynchronous Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Async?\n",
    "Asynchronous programming allows:\n",
    "- Better performance for I/O-bound operations (API calls)\n",
    "- Non-blocking execution\n",
    "- Concurrent operations\n",
    "- Improved scalability\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Changes from Sync Version\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Async Node Definition\n",
    "```python\n",
    "async def chat_node(state: ChatState):\n",
    "    messages = state[\"messages\"]\n",
    "    response = await llm_with_tools.ainvoke(messages)  # Note: ainvoke\n",
    "    return {'messages': [response]}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Point**: Use `ainvoke()` instead of `invoke()` for async operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Async Graph Building\n",
    "```python\n",
    "async def main():\n",
    "    chatbot = build_graph()\n",
    "    result = await chatbot.ainvoke({\"messages\": [...]})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Jupyter-Specific Execution\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ❌ DON'T use asyncio.run() in Jupyter\n",
    "# asyncio.run(main())\n",
    "\n",
    "# ✅ DO use await directly\n",
    "await main()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Critical Learning**: Jupyter notebooks already run in an event loop. Using `asyncio.run()` will cause:\n",
    "```\n",
    "RuntimeError: asyncio.run() cannot be called from a running event loop\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You Learned\n",
    "- ✅ Converting synchronous LangGraph to async\n",
    "- ✅ Proper async/await patterns in Jupyter\n",
    "- ✅ Difference between `invoke()` and `ainvoke()`\n",
    "- ✅ Event loop management in notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Section 3: MCP Server Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is MCP?\n",
    "**Model Context Protocol** is a standardized way to expose tools, resources, and prompts to LLMs. It allows:\n",
    "- Connecting LLMs to external data sources\n",
    "- Exposing APIs as tools\n",
    "- Building modular, reusable tool servers\n",
    "- Combining multiple tool providers\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### MCP Client Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "client = MultiServerMCPClient(\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        \"arith\": {\n",
    "            \"transport\": \"stdio\",\n",
    "            \"command\": \"/path/to/python\",\n",
    "            \"args\": [\"/path/to/main.py\"],\n",

    "        \"expense\": {\n",
    "            \"transport\": \"streamable_http\",\n",
    "            \"url\": \"https://example.fastmcp.app/mcp\"\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Points**:\n",
    "- **stdio transport**: Launches a local process, communicates via stdin/stdout\n",
    "- **streamable_http transport**: Connects to HTTP-based MCP servers\n",
    "- Use full path to Python executable to ensure correct virtual environment\n",
    "- Each server gets a unique identifier (\"arith\", \"expense\")\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dynamic Tool Loading\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "async def build_graph():\n",
    "    tools = await client.get_tools()  # Fetches tools from all servers\n",
    "    print(f\"Loaded tools: {[t.name for t in tools]}\")\n",
    "    llm_with_tools = llm.bind_tools(tools)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Point**: Tools are fetched dynamically at runtime, allowing flexible integration without hardcoding tool definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Groq API Compatibility Fix\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "async def chat_node(state: ChatState):\n",
    "    messages = state[\"messages\"]\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Fix tool message format for Groq\n",
    "    for msg in messages:\n",
    "        if msg.type == \"tool\" and not isinstance(msg.content, str):\n",
    "            msg.content = json.dumps(msg.content)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    response = await llm_with_tools.ainvoke(messages)\n",
    "    return {'messages': [response]}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Critical Learning**: Different LLM providers have different requirements:\n",
    "- **Groq** requires tool messages to have string content\n",
    "- **MCP tools** often return structured objects or content arrays\n",
    "- Solution: Convert complex tool outputs to JSON strings\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You Learned\n",
    "- ✅ Model Context Protocol fundamentals\n",
    "- ✅ Connecting to local MCP servers (stdio)\n",
    "- ✅ Connecting to remote MCP servers (HTTP)\n",
    "- ✅ Managing multiple MCP servers simultaneously\n",
    "- ✅ Handling LLM provider-specific formatting requirements\n",
    "- ✅ Dynamic tool discovery and integration\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Learnings\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Graph-Based Agent Architecture**\n",
    "LangGraph provides a powerful abstraction for building agents:\n",
    "- **Nodes** represent operations (LLM calls, tool execution)\n",
    "- **Edges** define control flow\n",
    "- **Conditional edges** enable dynamic routing\n",
    "- **State** maintains conversation context\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Tool Calling Patterns**\n",
    "```\n",
    "User Message → LLM (decides to use tool) → Tool Execution → LLM (uses result) → Final Response\n",
    "```\n",
    "This pattern can repeat multiple times in one conversation turn.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Async is Essential for Production**\n",
    "- Enables concurrent tool calls\n",
    "- Better resource utilization\n",
    "- Improved response times\n",
    "- Scales better under load\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **MCP Enables Modularity**\n",
    "- Separate tool logic from agent logic\n",
    "- Tools can be written in any language\n",
    "- Easy to swap or upgrade tool providers\n",
    "- Share tools across different agents/applications\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Provider-Specific Quirks**\n",
    "Different LLM providers have different:\n",
    "- Message format requirements\n",
    "- Tool calling conventions\n",
    "- Rate limits and performance characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "Always test with your specific provider and handle edge cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Issues and Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Issue 1: `asyncio.run()` Error in Jupyter\n",
    "**Error**: `RuntimeError: asyncio.run() cannot be called from a running event loop`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**: Use `await` directly instead of `asyncio.run()`\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ❌ Wrong\n",
    "asyncio.run(main())\n",
    "\n",
    "# ✅ Correct\n",
    "await main()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Issue 2: Tool Message Format Error with Groq\n",
    "**Error**: `BadRequestError: 'messages.2.content' : value must be a string`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**: Convert tool outputs to strings\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for msg in messages:\n",
    "    if msg.type == \"tool\" and not isinstance(msg.content, str):\n",
    "        msg.content = json.dumps(msg.content)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Issue 3: MCP Server Not Found\n",
    "**Error**: Server fails to start or connect\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solutions**:\n",
    "- Use absolute path to Python interpreter\n",
    "- Verify virtual environment is activated\n",
    "- Check that FastMCP server file exists\n",
    "- Ensure all dependencies are installed in the correct environment\n",
    "\n",
    "### Issue 4: Tools Not Being Called\n",
    "**Possible Causes**:\n",
    "- Tool description is unclear to the LLM\n",
    "- Tool parameters don't match user request\n",
    "- LLM decides the task doesn't require tools\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solutions**:\n",
    "- Write clear, specific tool docstrings\n",
    "- Test with explicit requests (\"use the calculator tool...\")\n",
    "- Check if LLM has general knowledge of the task\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Best Practices\n",

    "\n",
    "### 2. State Management\n",
    "- ✅ Use `add_messages` for automatic message accumulation\n",
    "- ✅ Keep state minimal - only store what's needed\n",
    "- ✅ Use TypedDict for type safety\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Error Handling\n",
    "- ✅ Wrap tool execution in try-except blocks\n",
    "- ✅ Return informative error messages\n",
    "- ✅ Log errors for debugging\n",
    "- ✅ Provide fallback behavior when tools fail\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Performance\n",
    "- ✅ Use async for I/O-bound operations\n",
    "- ✅ Consider caching tool results when appropriate\n",
    "- ✅ Set reasonable timeouts for tool execution\n",
    "- ✅ Monitor API rate limits\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. MCP Integration\n",
    "- ✅ Use separate MCP servers for different domains\n",
    "- ✅ Version your MCP servers\n",
    "- ✅ Document tool schemas clearly\n",
    "- ✅ Test MCP servers independently before integration\n",
    "\n",
