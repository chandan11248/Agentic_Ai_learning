    "\n",
    "This is my **practice notebook** while learning **LangGraph Persistence** for building fault-tolerant agentic AI workflows. Not a production project — just hands-on experimentation with **checkpointing, time travel, and failure recovery**! 🧪\n",

    "\n",
    "- How to **persist state** across workflow executions\n",

    "- **Time travel** — resuming from any previous checkpoint\n",
    "- **Fault tolerance** — recovering from failures without losing progress\n",
    "- **State modification** — updating state at specific checkpoints\n",
    "- **Thread management** — organizing workflows by thread IDs\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Viewing Current State\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Get current state\n",
    "current_state = workflow.get_state(config=config)\n",
    "print(current_state.values)  # Current values\n",
    "print(current_state.next)    # Next node to execute\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Viewing State History\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Get all checkpoints for this thread\n",
    "history = list(workflow.get_state_history(config=config))\n",

       " 'joke': 'Why did my cat bring a coffin to the vet?  \\nBecause it was tired of being a “purr‑sister” in life and wanted to finally get a *real* *purr‑cess* of death.',\n",
       " 'explanation': '### Breaking Down the Joke\\n\\n| **Element** | **What it is** | **How it works in the joke** |\\n|-------------|----------------|------------------------------|\\n| **Cat** | A common household pet, known for its “purr” sound. | The subject of the joke; everything hinges on the cat’s purr‑related wordplay. |\\n| **Coffin** | A box for burying a dead body. | It’s an absurd thing for a cat to bring to a vet, which immediately signals that the punchline will involve death or burial. |\\n| **Vet** | A veterinarian, a professional who cares for animals. | The setting (the vet’s office) is a familiar place for a cat, adding to the absurdity of a coffin being brought there. |\\n| **Purr‑sister** | A play on the word *pursuit* (or *pursuer*), but with “purr” inserted. | “Purr‑sister” sounds like “pursister,” suggesting the cat is constantly “pursuing” something—in this case, life. It also hints at “pursuit of life” or “pursuit of being a cat.” |\\n| **Purr‑cess** | A pun on the word *process*, specifically the “process of death” (i.e., the funeral or burial process). | The double asterisks in the joke highlight it as a key pun: the cat wants a *real* “purr‑cess” of death, meaning it wants a proper, serious, and perhaps *cat‑centric* approach to death. |\\n| **“Real”** | Emphasizes that the cat wants something authentic, not just a joke or a fake. | It underscores the cat’s desire for a genuine, not whimsical, death experience. |\\n\\n#### The Setup\\n\\n- **“Why did my cat bring a coffin to the vet?”**  \\n  - This question immediately sets up a classic “why did X do Y” joke. The expectation is that the answer will be a funny or absurd twist. The image of a cat carrying a coffin is already comedic because a cat is not a funeral director or a coffin‑builder.\\n\\n#### The Punchline\\n\\n- **“Because it was tired of being a “purr‑sister” in life and wanted to finally get a *real* *purr‑cess* of death.”**  \\n  1. **Tired of being a “purr‑sister”**  \\n     - The cat is tired of “purring” (its natural behavior) and perhaps of the endless cycle of chasing mice, sleeping, and being adored. The word “purr‑sister” is a mash‑up of *purr* and *pursister* (a play on *pursuer* or *pursuit*). It suggests the cat is constantly “pursuing” life, or that it has been living in a “purr‑sistent” (persistent) state of life.  \\n  2. **Wanted to finally get a *real* *purr‑cess* of death**  \\n     - The cat desires a “real” death process—a proper funeral, burial, or at least a formal acknowledgment of its own mortality. The pun *purr‑cess* replaces *process* with *purr*, linking the cat’s identity (purring) to the concept of death.  \\n     - The double asterisks around *purr‑cess* mimic the way people sometimes emphasize a word in a joke, making it clear that the pun is intentional.  \\n\\n#### Why It’s Funny\\n\\n1. **Word‑play** – The humor comes from the creative blending of “purr” with everyday words (*pursister* and *process*). Word‑play jokes rely on the listener noticing the double meaning.  \\n2. **Absurdity** – A cat bringing a coffin to a vet is an absurd visual. The absurdity is amplified by the idea that the cat is *actively* seeking a death process.  \\n3. **Anthropomorphism** – The cat is given a human motive (“tired of life”) and a human activity (seeking a funeral). This anthropomorphic twist is a common comedic device.  \\n4. **Play on expectations** – The question leads the audience to expect a simple, silly answer (e.g., “Because it was a little *dead*”). Instead, the answer is a clever pun that flips the expectation.\\n\\n#### How to Use or Adapt It\\n\\n- **Variation**: “Why did the hamster bring a coffin to the vet? Because it was tired of being a *ham‑ster* in life and wanted a *real* *ham‑ster* of death.” (Swap “purr” with “ham.”)  \\n- **Teaching**: Use it in a lesson about puns, homophones, or word‑play.  \\n- **Social Media**: Pair the joke with a cute cat picture holding a tiny coffin to maximize the visual punch.\\n\\nIn short, the joke relies on a clever pun that ties a cat’s defining trait (purring) to the concepts of pursuit and death, all wrapped in an absurd scenario that surprises and delights the listener.'}"

The expectation is that the answer will be a funny or absurd twist. The image of a cat carrying a coffin is already comedic because a cat is not a funeral director or a coffin‑builder.\\n\\n#### The Punchline\\n\\n- **“Because it was tired of being a “purr‑sister” in life and wanted to finally get a *real* *purr‑cess* of death.”**  \\n  1. **Tired of being a “purr‑sister”**  \\n     - The cat is tired of “purring” (its natural behavior) and perhaps of the endless cycle of chasing mice, sleeping, and being adored. The word “purr‑sister” is a mash‑up of *purr* and *pursister* (a play on *pursuer* or *pursuit*). It suggests the cat is constantly “pursuing” life, or that it has been living in a “purr‑sistent” (persistent) state of life.  \\n  2. **Wanted to finally get a *real* *purr‑cess* of death**  \\n     - The cat desires a “real” death process—a proper funeral, burial, or at least a formal acknowledgment of its own mortality. The pun *purr‑cess* replaces *process* with *purr*, linking the cat’s identity (purring) to the concept of death.  \\n     - The double asterisks around *purr‑cess* mimic the way people sometimes emphasize a word in a joke, making it clear that the pun is intentional.  \\n\\n#### Why It’s Funny\\n\\n1. **Word‑play** – The humor comes from the creative blending of “purr” with everyday words (*pursister* and *process*). Word‑play jokes rely on the listener noticing the double meaning.  \\n2. **Absurdity** – A cat bringing a coffin to a vet is an absurd visual. The absurdity is amplified by the idea that the cat is *actively* seeking a death process.  \\n3. **Anthropomorphism** – The cat is given a human motive (“tired of life”) and a human activity (seeking a funeral). This anthropomorphic twist is a common comedic device.  \\n4. **Play on expectations** – The question leads the audience to expect a simple, silly answer (e.g., “Because it was a little *dead*”). Instead, the answer is a clever pun that flips the expectation.\\n\\n#### How to Use or Adapt It\\n\\n- **Variation**: “Why did the hamster bring a coffin to the vet? Because it was tired of being a *ham‑ster* in life and wanted a *real* *ham‑ster* of death.” (Swap “purr” with “ham.”)  \\n- **Teaching**: Use it in a lesson about puns, homophones, or word‑play.  \\n- **Social Media**: Pair the joke with a cute cat picture holding a tiny coffin to maximize the visual punch.\\n\\nIn short, the joke relies on a clever pun that ties a cat’s defining trait (purring) to the concepts of pursuit and death, all wrapped in an absurd scenario that surprises and delights the listener.'}, next=(), config={'configurable': {'thread_id': '1', 'checkpoint_ns': '', 'checkpoint_id': '1f0d7fc4-c187-6bc2-8002-d97951681e38'}}, metadata={'source': 'loop', 'step': 2, 'parents': {}}, created_at='2025-12-13T08:18:25.688837+00:00', parent_config={'configurable': {'thread_id': '1', 'checkpoint_ns': '', 'checkpoint_id': '1f0d7fc4-b3bb-6f5c-8001-e87ddf8ca2d7'}}, tasks=(), interrupts=())"

It also hints at “pursuit of life” or “pursuit of being a cat.” |\\n| **Purr‑cess** | A pun on the word *process*, specifically the “process of death” (i.e., the funeral or burial process). | The double asterisks in the joke highlight it as a key pun: the cat wants a *real* “purr‑cess” of death, meaning it wants a proper, serious, and perhaps *cat‑centric* approach to death. |\\n| **“Real”** | Emphasizes that the cat wants something authentic, not just a joke or a fake. | It underscores the cat’s desire for a genuine, not whimsical, death experience. |\\n\\n#### The Setup\\n\\n- **“Why did my cat bring a coffin to the vet?”**  \\n  - This question immediately sets up a classic “why did X do Y” joke. The expectation is that the answer will be a funny or absurd twist. The image of a cat carrying a coffin is already comedic because a cat is not a funeral director or a coffin‑builder.\\n\\n#### The Punchline\\n\\n- **“Because it was tired of being a “purr‑sister” in life and wanted to finally get a *real* *purr‑cess* of death.”**  \\n  1. **Tired of being a “purr‑sister”**  \\n     - The cat is tired of “purring” (its natural behavior) and perhaps of the endless cycle of chasing mice, sleeping, and being adored. The word “purr‑sister” is a mash‑up of *purr* and *pursister* (a play on *pursuer* or *pursuit*). It suggests the cat is constantly “pursuing” life, or that it has been living in a “purr‑sistent” (persistent) state of life.  \\n  2. **Wanted to finally get a *real* *purr‑cess* of death**  \\n     - The cat desires a “real” death process—a proper funeral, burial, or at least a formal acknowledgment of its own mortality. The pun *purr‑cess* replaces *process* with *purr*, linking the cat’s identity (purring) to the concept of death.  \\n     - The double asterisks around *purr‑cess* mimic the way people sometimes emphasize a word in a joke, making it clear that the pun is intentional.  \\n\\n#### Why It’s Funny\\n\\n1. **Word‑play** – The humor comes from the creative blending of “purr” with everyday words (*pursister* and *process*). Word‑play jokes rely on the listener noticing the double meaning.  \\n2. **Absurdity** – A cat bringing a coffin to a vet is an absurd visual. The absurdity is amplified by the idea that the cat is *actively* seeking a death process.  \\n3. **Anthropomorphism** – The cat is given a human motive (“tired of life”) and a human activity (seeking a funeral). This anthropomorphic twist is a common comedic device.  \\n4. **Play on expectations** – The question leads the audience to expect a simple, silly answer (e.g., “Because it was a little *dead*”). Instead, the answer is a clever pun that flips the expectation.\\n\\n#### How to Use or Adapt It\\n\\n- **Variation**: “Why did the hamster bring a coffin to the vet? Because it was tired of being a *ham‑ster* in life and wanted a *real* *ham‑ster* of death.” (Swap “purr” with “ham.”)  \\n- **Teaching**: Use it in a lesson about puns, homophones, or word‑play.  \\n- **Social Media**: Pair the joke with a cute cat picture holding a tiny coffin to maximize the visual punch.\\n\\nIn short, the joke relies on a clever pun that ties a cat’s defining trait (purring) to the concepts of pursuit and death, all wrapped in an absurd scenario that surprises and delights the listener.'}),), interrupts=()),\n",
