    "# 📚 LangGraph Learning - Persistence & Checkpointing Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "This is my **practice notebook** while learning **LangGraph Persistence** for building fault-tolerant agentic AI workflows. Not a production project — just hands-on experimentation with **checkpointing, time travel, and failure recovery**! 🧪\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 What I'm Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "- How to **persist state** across workflow executions\n",
    "- **Checkpointing** with `InMemorySaver`\n",
    "- **Time travel** — resuming from any previous checkpoint\n",
    "- **Fault tolerance** — recovering from failures without losing progress\n",
    "- **State modification** — updating state at specific checkpoints\n",
    "- **Thread management** — organizing workflows by thread IDs\n",

    "|---------|----------------|\n",
    "| `InMemorySaver` | In-memory checkpointer for development/testing |\n",
    "| `thread_id` | Groups related checkpoints together |\n",
    "| `checkpoint_id` | Unique identifier for each saved state |\n",

    "# Compile graph with checkpointer\n",
    "workflow = graph.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Running with Thread ID\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Config with thread_id groups checkpoints together\n",
    "config = {\"configurable\": {\"thread_id\": \"1\"}}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Run workflow\n",
    "result = workflow.invoke({\"topic\": \"cat\"}, config=config)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Viewing Current State\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Get current state\n",
    "current_state = workflow.get_state(config=config)\n",
    "print(current_state.values)  # Current values\n",
    "print(current_state.next)    # Next node to execute\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Viewing State History\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Get all checkpoints for this thread\n",
    "history = list(workflow.get_state_history(config=config))\n",
    "\n",
    "for state in history:\n",

    "\n",
    "# Continue from that checkpoint\n",
    "result = workflow.invoke(None, config=checkpoint_config)\n",
    "```\n",

    "### 6. Modifying State at Checkpoint\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "initial_state = {\"data\": \"Python programming\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "# First attempt\n",

    "except Exception as e:\n",
    "    print(f\"Failed: {e} - but state is saved!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Retry from checkpoint\n",
    "max_retries = 5\n",
    "for attempt in range(max_retries):\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        result = workflow.invoke(None, config=config)  # None = resume\n",

    "\n",
    "## 💡 Notes to Self\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`thread_id`** — Groups related runs together (like a conversation ID)\n",
    "- **`checkpoint_id`** — Unique ID for each saved state\n",
    "- **`invoke(None, config)`** — Resumes from last checkpoint\n",
    "- **`get_state_history()`** — Returns checkpoints in reverse order (newest first)\n",
    "- **`update_state()`** — Creates a NEW checkpoint, doesn't modify existing one\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚠️ Gotchas I Encountered\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **InMemorySaver data is lost on kernel restart** — Use SqliteSaver for persistence\n",
    "2. **checkpoint_ns must be empty string** — Not `None`, use `\"\"`\n",
    "3. **History is reverse chronological** — Newest checkpoint first\n",
    "4. **update_state creates new checkpoint** — It doesn't modify the old one\n",
    "5. **Resume needs same thread_id** — Or it won't find the checkpoints\n",

The set‑up\\n\\nThe joke starts with a classic “Why did ___ do ___?” question that sets up a situation that is **unexpected** and **anthropomorphic**.  \\n- **Tiger**: a fierce predator, not something we normally think of as having emotions like guilt or needing therapy.  \\n- **Grief‑counseling class**: a human activity that deals with emotional pain and loss.\\n\\nThe absurd image of a tiger going to a human counseling session already primes the listener for a twist.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 2.  The punchline\\n\\n> “Because every time it caught a prey, it felt a little… *tiger* of guilt.”\\n\\nThe humor hinges on two things:\\n\\n| Element | What it does | Why it’s funny |\\n|---------|--------------|----------------|\\n| **“tiger” in place of “bit”** | The phrase “a little bit of guilt” is turned into “a little *tiger* of guilt.” | It’s a playful word‑play that replaces a common word (“bit”) with the subject of the joke (“tiger”). The listener hears a familiar phrase but the word is suddenly the animal, which is absurd and unexpected. |\\n| **Anthropomorphism + irony** | The tiger is portrayed as feeling *guilt* after killing prey—an emotion usually reserved for humans. | The irony of a predator feeling remorse, combined with the idea that guilt can be quantified as a “tiger of guilt,” gives the joke a double layer: the literal animal and the figurative “tiger” (big, fierce) of guilt. |\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 3.  Why the pun works\\n\\n- **Sound similarity**: “tiger” and “bit” share the “‑t” sound, so the substitution feels natural enough to be recognized as a joke.  \\n- **Visual image**: When you say “a little *tiger* of guilt,” you picture a tiny tiger standing beside a larger tiger of guilt—this visual absurdity adds to the humor.  \\n- **Word‑play tradition**: English humor loves “puns” where a word is swapped for a similar‑sounding word that changes meaning. This joke fits that tradition perfectly.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 4.  Bottom line\\n\\nThe joke is funny because it:\\n\\n1. **Throws a familiar human situation (grief counseling) into an animal context** – a tiger needing therapy.\\n2. **Uses a pun to turn a common phrase into something absurd** – “tiger of guilt” instead of “bit of guilt.”\\n3. **Adds irony** – a predator feeling guilt after killing prey, which is a moral concept usually reserved for sentient beings.\\n\\nIn short, the joke is a neat blend of anthropomorphism, absurdity, and word‑play that lands on the punchline “tiger of guilt.”'}"
